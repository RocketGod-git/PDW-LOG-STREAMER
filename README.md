# PDW-LOG-STREAMER
<br>
This is a Python script which sends all new additions to the PWD log file to a webhook.<br>
I'm currently using a HackRF but any SDR dongle such as RTL-SDR will work.<br>
Run SDR# or similar piped to PDW via a virtual audio cable and use this script to stream the log file to a discord webhook.<br>
It works well.<br>

Ask me for an invite to my Discord server to see it in action.<br
