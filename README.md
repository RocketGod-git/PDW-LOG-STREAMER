# PDW-LOG-STREAMER

## SDR++ and PDW Integration

This repository contains a script that integrates SDR++ and PDW to monitor changes to a log file generated by PDW and send messages to a Discord webhook.

## Installation

### SDR++

To install SDR++, follow the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus).

### PDW

To install PDW, download the latest version of the software from the [official website](http://www.discriminator.nl/pdw/index-en.html) and follow the installation instructions provided.

### Script

To install the script, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RocketGod-git/PDW-LOG-STREAMER
```

```sh
cd PDW-LOG-STREAMER
```

All dependencies will automatically install on first run.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to create a `config.json` file in the same directory as the script. This file should have the following format:

```json
{
  "webhook_url": "YOUR-DISCORD-WEBHOOK-HERE"
}
```

Next, copy the `webhook.py` script and the `config.json` file to the PDW logging folder. 

## Usage

To run the script, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the PDW logging folder. Then, run the following command:

```sh
python webhook.py
```

The script will monitor changes to the log file generated by PDW and send messages to the Discord webhook specified in the `config.json` file.
